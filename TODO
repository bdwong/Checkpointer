TOOD:
- Create easy-access module for rails controllers
- Detect if database is tracked and start tracking on instantiation.
- Create log tracker
- Cucumber tests on real databases
- Create a refresh method to re-track tables that have become untracked because they were dropped and created.

- Rescue unknown database when instantiating Checkpointer:
Mysql2::Error: Unknown database 'database_backup_x'

- Rescue when tracking table doesn't exist when restoring checkpoint:
Mysql2::Error: Table 'database.updated_tables' doesn't exist
This could happen if tracking was not started.
- DatabaseCopier.copy_tables should raise ::Checkpointer::Database::DatabaseNotFoundError if source database is missing.
