TOOD:
- Reflect the current gem install command line
- Discuss database setup and permissions in README
- Specs that expect the correct sql query strings on execute()
- Cucumber tests on real databases

- Rescue unknown database when instantiating Checkpointer:
Mysql2::Error: Unknown database 'database_backup_x'
- drivers should raise ::Checkpointer::Database::DatabaseNotFoundError when Mysql2::Error is raised with e.errno == 1049 or /^Unknown database/

- Rescue when tracking table doesn't exist when restoring checkpoint:
Mysql2::Error: Table 'database.updated_tables' doesn't exist
This could happen if tracking was not started.
- DatabaseCopier.copy_tables should raise ::Checkpointer::Database::DatabaseNotFoundError if source database is missing.
